# Dark Mode Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified
The dark mode had several visibility issues where text and components had hardcoded colors that didn't adapt to the theme.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Theme Configuration** (`App.jsx`)
Enhanced the Material-UI theme with proper dark mode palette:
```javascript
- Added dynamic primary color: #90caf9 (light blue) for dark mode
- Added dynamic secondary color: #f48fb1 (pink) for dark mode
- Set background.default: #121212 for dark mode
- Set background.paper: #1e1e1e for dark mode
```

### 2. **Paper Components** (`App.jsx`)
Fixed hardcoded backgrounds to use theme-aware colors:
- Changed `background: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.95)'` → `bgcolor: 'background.paper'`
- Changed `background: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.98)'` → `bgcolor: 'background.paper'`

### 3. **Typography Components** (`App.jsx`)
Replaced hardcoded colors with theme tokens:
- Main heading: `color: darkMode ? '#fff' : '#1a237e'` → `color: 'text.primary'`
- Section heading: `color: darkMode ? '#90caf9' : '#1a237e'` → `color: 'text.primary'`
- Bank details: `color: '#3949ab'` → `color: 'primary.main'`

### 4. **TextField Component** (`App.jsx`)
Updated search input background:
- Changed from hardcoded colors to theme-aware: `bgcolor: darkMode ? 'rgba(255,255,255,0.05)' : 'action.hover'`

### 5. **StatsCard Component**
Fixed card backgrounds and gradients:
- Changed from hardcoded `background` to `bgcolor: 'background.paper'`
- Added subtle gradient overlay using `backgroundImage` that works in both modes
- Typography automatically inherits theme colors

### 6. **CompareModal Component**
Updated comparison result cards:
- Bank 1 card: Uses theme-aware primary color with gradient overlay
- Bank 2 card: Uses theme-aware secondary color with gradient overlay
- Both cards use `bgcolor: 'background.paper'` as base

## Results

### Light Mode
- Clean white backgrounds
- Dark text (#1a237e, #1976d2)
- High contrast for readability

### Dark Mode
- Dark paper backgrounds (#1e1e1e)
- Light blue primary (#90caf9)
- Pink secondary (#f48fb1)
- White text for headers
- Gray text for secondary content
- All text is now clearly visible

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Theme Switching** - All components now respect the theme mode
2. **Consistent Design** - Uses Material-UI's theme tokens throughout
3. **Better Accessibility** - Proper contrast ratios in both modes
4. **Future-Proof** - Easy to adjust colors by changing theme config only
